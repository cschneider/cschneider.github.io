## Welcome to liquid-reality, the Blog of Christian Schneider

I am a computer scientist working at Adobe on the Adobe Experience Manager Platform team. We providing the core of AEM based on open source projects (Apache Sling, Apache Felix, ...) and extended with some Adobe specific code for our feature teams to create Experience manager on top. I am working on quite a few [Apache open source projects](http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=cschneider) like Felix, Karaf, CXF, Camel.  

I am interested in clean code and modular software design.
