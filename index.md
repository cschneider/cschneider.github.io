I am a computer scientist working at Adobe on the Adobe Experience Manager Platform team.
On the open source side I work on quite a few [Apache open source projects](http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=cschneider) like Felix, Karaf, CXF, Camel.  
I am interested in clean code, software architecture and modular software design.
