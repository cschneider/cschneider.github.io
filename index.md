I am a computer scientist working at Adobe on the Adobe Experience Manager Platform team.
We provide the core of AEM based on open source projects (Apache Sling, Apache Felix, ...)
and extended it with some Adobe specific modules for our feature teams to create Experience manager on top.

I am working on quite a few [Apache open source projects](http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=cschneider) like Felix, Karaf, CXF, Camel.  
I am interested in clean code, software architecture and modular software design.
