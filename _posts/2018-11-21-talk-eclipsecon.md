We will look at common cloud and design patterns and see how the special properties of the OSGi environment allow us to rethink these patterns. The talk shows some well-known patterns like the service registry and the whiteboard but also some unique patterns like out of band circuit breaker or graceful degregation.

For OSGi beginners, the well established OSGi patterns will help getting started the right way. Experienced OSGi developers will find some new patterns to think about. Cloud or enterprise developers will get a new approach to some patterns they are used to which hopefully inspires them to take another look at the current state of OSGi.
